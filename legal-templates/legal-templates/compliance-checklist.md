# ✅ 2026 AI Content Creator Compliance Checklist

Use this checklist to verify the legal standing of your synthetic media assets before publication under the No FAKES Act and IT Rules 2026.

### 1. Identity & Consent
- [ ] **Written Consent:** Do I have a signed "Digital Twin" license for every voice and likeness used?
- [ ] **Contract Scope:** Does the contract specifically allow for the intended commercial use-case?

### 2. Technical Transparency
- [ ] **AI Labeling:** Is the content clearly labeled as "Synthetic" or "AI-Generated"?
- [ ] **Watermarking:** Are the C2PA or SynthID provenance markers embedded and untampered?

### 3. Liability Mitigation
- [ ] **Indemnity Audit:** Have I verified that my AI tool provider offers "Commercial Indemnity"?
- [ ] **Insurance Review:** Is my "Digital Identity" covered by a 2026-standard deepfake insurance policy?
